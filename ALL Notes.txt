    ii.) Create functions.inc.php ---> here all the functions(methods) will be added which can be used globally also. ---> e.g. you want to create an array you create a seperate function which will print the array.----> so everytime just call this function.
    iii.) Create login.php ---> code with validations.
        ==> created form to enter email, password and login
        ==> if the admin matches, then let the user redirect to categories page and also set sessions.
    iV.) Created header.inc.php, footer.inc.php, categories.php
        ==> created navbar in header.inc.php where logout option is there, if admin clicks on logout the sessions are made unset.
        ==> in categories.php created table to add the categories from "table->categories" where while loop is used to add records one-by-one.
